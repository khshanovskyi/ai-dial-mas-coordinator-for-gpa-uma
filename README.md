# MAS (Multi Agent System) Coordinator to Work with General-purpose and Users Management Agents

**This is the simplest version of MAS Coordinator that works as a *router* between GPA and UMS Agents**


### Task 1: Preparation of docker compose with all the services:
<details>
<summary>Task 1</summary>

Prepare [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) with all the services:
1. Add `redis-insight` service to check later that conversations from UMSA and cached from DIAL are there
    ```yaml
      redis-insight:
        image: redislabs/redisinsight:latest
        depends_on:
          - redis
        ports:
          - "6380:5540"
    ```
   How to connect (do it when all the services are configured and you run docker-compose):
    - Open http://localhost:6380
    - Add connection to `redis`, pay attention that both of them are running in Docker environment and you should connect not through localhost, but through service name `redis`
2. Add `userservice`:
    ```yaml
      userservice:
        image: khshanovskyi/mockuserservice:latest
        ports:
          - "8040:8000"
        environment:
          - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
          - GENERATE_USERS=true
          - USER_COUNT=1000
        volumes:
          - ./data:/app/data
    ```
3. Add `ums-mcp-server`:
    ```yaml
      ums-mcp-server:
        depends_on:
          - redis
          - userservice
        image: khshanovskyi/ums-mcp-server:latest
        ports:
          - "8041:8005"
        environment:
          - USERS_MANAGEMENT_SERVICE_URL=${USERS_MANAGEMENT_SERVICE_URL:-http://userservice:8000}
        volumes:
          - ./data:/app/data
    ```
4. Add `ums-agent` (it is the same [UMS Agent](https://github.com/khshanovskyi/ai-dial-ums-ui-agent/tree/completed) that we have implemented earlier):
    ```yaml
      ums-agent:
        depends_on:
          - redis
          - ums-mcp-server
        image: khshanovskyi/dial-ums-agent:latest
        ports:
          - "8042:8000"
        environment:
          - UMS_MCP_URL=http://ums-mcp-server:8005/mcp
          - DIAL_API_KEY=${DIAL_API_KEY}
          - ORCHESTRATION_MODEL=gpt-4o
          - DIAL_URL=https://ai-proxy.lab.epam.com
          - REDIS_HOST=redis
          - REDIS_PORT=6379
        volumes:
          - ./data:/app/data
          - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    ```
    **Pay attention that you need to set up DIAL_API_KEY as env variable on your machine, or insert is instead of ${DIAL_API_KEY}**
5. Add `python-interpreter-mcp-server`:
    ```yaml
      python-interpreter-mcp-server:
        image: khshanovskyi/python-code-interpreter-mcp-server:latest
        ports:
          - "8050:8000"
        environment:
          LOG_LEVEL: "INFO"
        restart: unless-stopped
        mem_limit: 2G
        cpus: 2.0
    ```
6. Add `ddg-search-mcp-server`:
    ```yaml
      ddg-search-mcp-server:
        image: khshanovskyi/ddg-mcp-server:latest
        ports:
          - "8051:8000"
        environment:
          LOG_LEVEL: "INFO"
          MCP_TRANSPORT: "streamable-http"
        restart: unless-stopped
        mem_limit: 512M
        cpus: 0.5
    ```
7. Add `general-purpose-agen` (it is the same [GPA](https://github.com/khshanovskyi/ai-dial-general-purpose-agent/tree/completed) that we have implemented earlier):
    ```yaml
      general-purpose-agent:
        depends_on:
          - redis
          - python-interpreter-mcp-server
          - ddg-search-mcp-server
        image: khshanovskyi/dial-gpa-agent:latest
        ports:
          - "8052:5000"
        environment:
          - DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o
          - DIAL_ENDPOINT=http://core:8080
          - PYINTERPRETER_MCP_URL=http://python-interpreter-mcp-server:8000/mcp
          - DDG_MCP_URL=http://ddg-search-mcp-server:8000/mcp
        volumes:
          - ./data:/app/data
    ```
8. Run [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) and test that it works:
   - Make POST request to http://localhost:8052/openai/deployments/general-purpose-agent/chat/completions `{"messages": [{"role": "user","content": "hi?"}]}` 
   - Create new conversation to UMS
